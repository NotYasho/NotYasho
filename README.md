## Features

### 1. **Good Looking and Functional UI ‚ú®**
I took inspiration from many sites and interfaces before coming up with this design. Besides, purple is my favourite color anyway :P

</p>

### 2. Responsive Design  üì±
I have tested the responsiveness on various devices to provide an (almost) consistent look and feel on various screen sizes. (I'm aware of the overflowing tags issue)

</p>

### **3. Article Search Functionality üîé**
The search feature queries the title and the description for a term.

</p>

### **4. Categorization of Articles üè∑Ô∏è**
This is done manually upon the creation of an article. Helps in navigating the site much faster. It's specially handy if you've got a bunch of stuff on here.

</p>

### **8. Low-quality Placeholders for Images üñºÔ∏è**
To maintain performance and visual appeal, I used placeholder images (provided by Sanity CMS) to optimise load times.
